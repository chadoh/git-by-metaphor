# Why Metaphors Matter

---

[!["git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space."](img/tabqwerty.png)](https://twitter.com/tabqwerty/status/45611899953491968)

[![Atlassian's description of git](img/atlassian.png)](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git)

???

All of these descriptions assume an audience who already know what "version control" is and why someone would want it. Beginners have been learning *only git* since at least 2010, so educators should not assume knowledge of some other version control system.

When we explain git, we must explain the concept of version control in general.

You can see his tidy series of "clips"/"pieces of protection".

He might be using _pitons_ or _hexes_ or _nuts_. In git, these are analagous to _commits_.

---

Let's try it.

???

Walk through starting to write a novel using git. Use an example from https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top

# What can we learn from this metaphor?

Climbing metaphor, *lesson 1*

# Commit often!

---

# Other lessons?

---

background-image: url(img/climbing-with-pitons.jpg)

???

Imagine this climber is exploring a first ascent; something that's never been climbed before, and he runs into...

* something he can't climb
* a dangerous situation like a bees nest

...What will he do?

Fall back to the previous "save point" and explore a new route!

---

Climbing metaphor, *lesson 2*

# We are always on our *first ascent*

--

We are always climbing something that's never been climbed before

---

Climbing metaphor, *lesson 2*

# We are always on our *first ascent*

We may run into something we can't climb

---

Climbing metaphor, *lesson 2*

# We are always on our *first ascent*

We never know where we'll find a *hive üêù of üêù bees*

---

Climbing metaphor, *lesson 2*

# We are always on our *first ascent*

*git branches* give us a two-routes-at-once advantage every climber wishes they had!

---

Let's try it.

???

Walk through feeling uncertain which direction to take the novel in.

* Create a branch for `chapter-3-wonder` and commit Chapter 3 from Alice in Wonderland.
* Create a branch for `chapter-3-monster` and commit Chapter 3 from Frankenstein

# Other lessons?

---

Climbing metaphor, *lesson 3*

# Commit messages don't matter

--

# üòû

---

background-image: url(img/git_commit_2x.png)

???

It's this sort of operating metaphor for git that makes a lot of people write commit messages like this.

https://xkcd.com/1296/

---

# Why do commit messages matter?


???

Walk through examples of using `git blame` and `tig` to explore commit history.

---

# Can we find a better metaphor?

--

One that helps us appreciate and understand commit messages?

---







# *Storytelling*

---

A *super* exciting story about

# how our project changes over time

---

background-image: url(img/flipboard-for-iphone.png)

???

On at least one occassion, commit messages have been compiled into an actual hard-bound book:

https://craigmod.com/journal/digital_physical/

&gt; Then at the back: the commits. All 9,569 of them. As you flip through this high-resolution macro view of the commit stack, the very texture of the page changes as new developers join the project; as the software jumps into different phases of development.

---

# what is a *commit* in this metaphor?

---

# each commit is a *paragraph*

---

# what makes a paragraph *good*?

---

storytelling metaphor, *lesson 1*

# commit messages require *artistry*

???

Walk through:

1. creating a new branch
2. adding a paragraph of http://www.rygo-ipsum.com, commiting
3. adding a paragraph of http://saganipsum.com, commiting
4. changing first paragraph, commiting
5. adding third paragraph from https://hipsum.co, commiting
6. editing all three, then cleaning up commits

---

# other lessons?

I'm asking you

One last metaphor
