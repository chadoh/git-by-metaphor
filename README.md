Talk Description
================

What is git? For people who have used it for years, it might not seem like it needs an explanation. "It's a version control system," they say. And all the newbies stare blankly.

Without metaphors, software concepts can feel really nebulous. It's hard to feel like you understand something when you haven't experienced anything else like it.

With a good metaphor, even people experienced with something can see it in a new light and deepen their artistry.

It took me seven years to find a metaphor for git that captures its most essential features. This talk will explore that and a couple other metaphors. Whether you're a newbie or an experienced professional, you should acquire a few new tools for thinking about git and becoming a better artist.
